// 6.1 There are elections in your country! In a small town, there are
// only 50 voters. Use a for loop to simulate the 50 people voting,
// by logging a string like this to the console (for numbers 1 to 50):
// 'Voter number 1 is currently voting
//  50 voters

//  Voters Numbers 1-50
// Make for loop from 1-50
// Output “string” == voter number () is currently voting

let voter = 50;
for (let i = 1; i < 50; i++) {
  console.log(`voter number ${i} is currently voting`);
}
